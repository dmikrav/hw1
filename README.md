Instructions:
Update sql connect parameters, your apikey, and url_file path in db_configuration file.

Also:
1. In the AWS environment I would have implemented it with a labmda function that will be 
trigered every time a url_list would be uploded to s3 bucket. The db would be any kind of RDS.
2. I could not find any 'categories' tag in the url api.
